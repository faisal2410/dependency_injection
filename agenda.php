Title: Understanding Dependency Injection in PHP Object-Oriented Programming

Agenda:
What is Dependency Injection?
Example of Dependency Injection with Tight Coupling
Dependency Injection: The Right Way



Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which an object receives other objects it depends on, rather than creating those dependencies itself. This pattern decouples the usage of a class from its creation, making code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain.

In simple terms, DI allows us to "inject" dependencies (like a database connection or logger) into a class, rather than the class creating those dependencies internally.
