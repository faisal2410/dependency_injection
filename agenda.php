Title: Iterating Over Objects in PHP Object-Oriented Programming

Agenda:

1.Introduction to Object Iteration in PHP
2.The Iterator Interface in PHP
3.Implementing the Iterator Interface in a Class
4.Using foreach to Iterate Over an Object
5.Practical Code Example: Building an Iterable Product Collection



iterating over objects: Sometimes, we have objects containing a list of items that we need to access one by one, much like how we iterate through arrays. In PHP, iterating over objects is made easy with the Iterator interface. Let's see how to make our classes iterable."

The Iterator Interface in PHP:

PHP has a built-in interface called Iterator that allows us to define custom logic for object iteration. This interface requires implementing several methods: current(), key(), next(), rewind(), and valid(). These methods help us control how an object will behave during iteration.
