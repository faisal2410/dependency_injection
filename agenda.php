Title: Understanding Traits in PHP Object-Oriented Programming

Agenda:
What are Traits?
Defining and Using Traits
Using Multiple Traits in a Single Class



In PHP, a Trait is a mechanism that allows us to reuse code across different classes without using inheritance. Traits help solve the issue of single inheritance by letting us inject specific behavior or methods into classes.

Unlike classes, traits cannot be instantiated on their own but are meant to be used inside a class. Think of traits as reusable sets of methods that can be shared across multiple classes without requiring those classes to be directly related.

Key Points:

Traits allow us to reuse code across multiple classes.
Traits help with code organization and reduce duplication.
Traits cannot be instantiated.
