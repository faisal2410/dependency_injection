Title: Understanding Comparing  objects in PHP Object-Oriented Programming

Agenda:

1. == compares the values (properties) of two objects.
2. === compares whether two objects are the same instance (reference).



PHP provides a way to compare objects either by reference or by comparing their properties. Using == compares if the objects have the same properties, while === checks if they are the exact same instance.
